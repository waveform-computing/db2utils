.. _WEEKS_IN_MONTH_ISO:

================================
WEEKSINMONTH_ISO scalar function
================================

Returns the number of weeks within the month that **ADATE** exists within, or
the number of weeks in **AMONTH** in **AYEAR**.

Prototypes
==========

.. code-block:: sql

    WEEKSINMONTH_ISO(AYEAR INTEGER, AMONTH INTEGER)
    WEEKSINMONTH_ISO(ADATE DATE)
    WEEKSINMONTH_ISO(ADATE TIMESTAMP)
    WEEKSINMONTH_ISO(ADATE VARCHAR(26))

    RETURNS SMALLINT


Description
===========

Returns the number of weeks in **AMONTH** in **AYEAR** (weeks start on a
Monday, and partial weeks are permitted at the start and end of the month), or
the number of weeks in the month that **ADATE** exists within depending on the
variant of the function that is called.

.. note::

    As far as I'm aware, ISO8601 doesn't say anything about weeks within a
    month, hence why this function differs from :ref:`WEEKS_IN_YEAR_ISO` which
    does *not* permit partial weeks at the start and end of a year. This
    function simply mirrors the functionality of :ref:`WEEKS_IN_MONTH` but with
    a definition of weeks that start on a Monday instead of Sunday.

Parameters
==========

AYEAR
    If provided, the year containing **AMONTH** for which to calculate the
    number of weeks.

AMONTH
    If provided, the month within **AYEAR** for which to calculate the number
    of weeks.

ADATE
    If provided, the date within the month for which to calculate the number of
    weeks. Either **AYEAR** and **AMONTH**, or **ADATE** must be provided.

Examples
========

Calculate the number of weeks in January 2010:

.. code-block:: sql

    VALUES WEEKSINMONTH_ISO(2010, 1);

::

    1
    ------
         5


Calculate the number of weeks in the months of 2010:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT MONTH(D) AS MONTH, WEEKSINMONTH_ISO(D) AS WEEKS
    FROM TABLE(DATE_RANGE('2010-01-01', '2010-12-01', 100));

::

    MONTH       WEEKS
    ----------- ------
              1      5
              2      4
              3      5
              4      5
