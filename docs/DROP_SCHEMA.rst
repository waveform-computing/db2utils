.. _DROP_SCHEMA:

=====================
DROP_SCHEMA procedure
=====================

Drops **ASCHEMA** and all objects within it.

Prototypes
==========

.. code-block:: sql

    DROP_SCHEMA(ASCHEMA VARCHAR(128))


Description
===========

DROP_SCHEMA is a utility procedure which drops all objects (tables, views,
triggers, sequences, aliases, etc.) in a schema and then drops the schema. It
was originally intended to make destruction of user-owned schemas easier (in
the event that a user no longer required access) but can also be used to make
writing upgrade scripts easier.

.. note::

    This procedure is effectively redundant since DB2 9.5 which includes
    the built-in procedure `ADMIN_DROP_SCHEMA`_, albeit with a somewhat more
    complicated calling convention.

Parameters
==========

ASCHEMA
    The name of the schema to drop.

Examples
========

Drop the *FRED* schema and all objects within it:

.. code-block:: sql

    CALL DROP_SCHEMA('FRED');


Drop all schemas which start with the characters *TEST:*

.. code-block:: sql

    BEGIN ATOMIC
      FOR T AS
        SELECT SCHEMANAME
        FROM SYSCAT.SCHEMATA
        WHERE SCHEMANAME LIKE 'TEST%'
      DO
        CALL DROP_SCHEMA(T.SCHEMANAME);
      END FOR;
    END!
