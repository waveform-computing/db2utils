.. _RESTORE_VIEW:

======================
RESTORE_VIEW procedure
======================

Restores the specified view which was previously saved with :ref:`SAVE_VIEW`.

Prototypes
==========

.. code-block:: sql

    RESTORE_VIEW(ASCHEMA VARCHAR(128), AVIEW VARCHAR(128))
    RESTORE_VIEW(AVIEW VARCHAR(128))


Description
===========

RESTORE_VIEW is a utility procedure which restores the specified view using the
SQL found in :ref:`SAVED_VIEWS`, which is populated initially by a call to
:ref:`SAVE_VIEW` or :ref:`SAVE_VIEWS`. It also implicitly calls
:ref:`RESTORE_AUTH` to ensure that authorizations are not lost. This is the
primary difference between using :ref:`SAVE_VIEW` and RESTORE_VIEW, and using
DB2's inoperative view mechanism with the :ref:`RECREATE_VIEW` procedure.

Another use of these procedures is in recreating views which need to be dropped
surrounding the update of a UDF.

.. note::

    This procedure is effectively redundant as of DB2 9.7 due to the new
    deferred revalidation functionality introduced in that version.

Parameters
==========

ASCHEMA
    If provided, the schema containing the view to restore. If omitted, this
    parameter defaults to the value of the *CURRENT SCHEMA* special register.

AVIEW
    The name of the view to restore.

Examples
========

Restore the definition of the *FINANCE.LEDGER_CHANGES* view:

.. code-block:: sql

    CALL RESTORE_VIEW('FINANCE', 'LEDGER_CHANGES');

Restore the definition of the *EMPLOYEE_CHANGES* view in the current schema:

.. code-block:: sql

    CALL RESTORE_VIEW('EMPLOYEE_CHANGES');
