.. _AUTH_TYPE:

=========================
AUTH_TYPE scalar function
=========================

Utility routine used by other routines to determine the type of an
authorization name when it isn't explicitly given.

Prototypes
==========

.. code-block:: sql

    AUTH_TYPE(AUTH_NAME VARCHAR(128))
    RETURNS VARCHAR(1)

Description
===========

This is a utility function used by the :ref:`COPY_AUTH` procedure, and other
associated procedures. Given an authorization name, this scalar function
returns ``'U'``, ``'G'``, or ``'R'`` to indicate that **AUTH_NAME** is a user,
group, or role respectively (based on the content of the system catalog
tables). If the name is undefined, ``'U'`` is returned, unless the name is
*PUBLIC* in which case ``'G'`` is returned (for consistency with the
catalog tables). If the name represents multiple authorization types, SQLSTATE
21000 is raised.

Parameters
==========

AUTH_NAME
    The authorization name to test for type.

Examples
========

Show the type of the *PUBLIC* authorization name.

.. code-block:: sql

    VALUES AUTH_TYPE('PUBLIC');

::

    1
    -
    G
