.. _SAVE_AUTH:

===================
SAVE_AUTH procedure
===================

Saves the authorizations of the specified relation for later restoration with
:ref:`RESTORE_AUTH`.

Prototypes
==========

.. code-block:: sql

    SAVE_AUTH(ASCHEMA VARCHAR(128), ATABLE VARCHAR(128))
    SAVE_AUTH(ATABLE VARCHAR(128))


Description
===========

SAVE_AUTH is a utility procedure which copies the authorization settings for
the specified table or view from `SYSCAT.TABAUTH`_ to :ref:`SAVED_AUTH` (a
utility table which exists in the same schema as the procedure). These saved
settings can then be restored with the :ref:`RESTORE_AUTH` procedure. These
procedures are primarily intended for use in conjunction with the other schema
evolution functions (like :ref:`RECREATE_VIEWS`).

.. warning::

    Column specific authorizations (stored in `SYSCAT.COLAUTH`_) are *not*
    saved and restored by these procedures.

.. note::

    :ref:`SAVE_AUTH` and :ref:`RESTORE_AUTH` are not used directly by
    :ref:`RECREATE_VIEW` because when a view is marked inoperative, all
    authorization information is immediately wiped from *SYSCAT.TABAUTH*.
    Hence, there is nothing to restore by the time :ref:`RECREATE_VIEW` is run.

    You must call :ref:`SAVE_AUTH` *before* performing the operation that will
    invalidate the view, and :ref:`RESTORE_AUTH` *after* running
    :ref:`RECREATE_VIEW`.  Alternatively, you may wish to use :ref:`SAVE_VIEW`
    and :ref:`RESTORE_VIEW` instead, which rely on :ref:`SAVE_AUTH` and
    :ref:`RESTORE_AUTH` implicitly.

Parameters
==========

ASCHEMA
    The name of the schema containing the table for which authorizations are to
    be saved. If this parameter is omitted, it defaults to the value of the
    *CURRENT SCHEMA* special register.

ATABLE
    The name of the table within **ASCHEMA** for which authorizations are to be
    saved.

Examples
========

Save the authorizations associated with the *FINANCE.LEDGER* table, drop the
table, recreate it with a definition derived from another table, then restore
the authorizations:

.. code-block:: sql

    SET SCHEMA FINANCE;
    CALL SAVE_AUTH('LEDGER');
    DROP TABLE LEDGER;
    CREATE TABLE LEDGER LIKE LEDGER_TEMPLATE;
    CALL RESTORE_AUTH('LEDGER');


*Advanced usage:* Copy the authorizations associated with *FINANCE.SALES* to
*FINANCE.SALES_HISTORY* by changing the content of the SAVED_AUTH table (which
is structured identically to the *SYSCAT.TABAUTH* table) between calls to
:ref:`SAVE_AUTH` and :ref:`RESTORE_AUTH`:

.. code-block:: sql

    SET SCHEMA FINANCE;
    CALL SAVE_AUTH('SALES');
    UPDATE UTILS.SAVED_AUTH
        SET TABNAME = 'SALES_HISTORY'
        WHERE TABNAME = 'SALES'
        AND TABSCHEMA = CURRENT SCHEMA;
    CALL RESTORE_AUTH('SALES_HISTORY');
