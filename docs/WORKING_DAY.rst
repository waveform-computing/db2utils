.. _WORKING_DAY:

==========================
WORKINGDAY scalar function
==========================

Calculates the working day of a specified date relative to another date which
defaults to the start of the month

Prototypes
==========

.. code-block:: sql

    WORKINGDAY(ADATE DATE, RELATIVE_TO DATE, ALOCATION VARCHAR(10))
    WORKINGDAY(ADATE DATE, RELATIVE_TO DATE)
    WORKINGDAY(ADATE DATE, ALOCATION VARCHAR(10))
    WORKINGDAY(ADATE DATE)

    RETURNS INTEGER


Description
===========

The WORKINGDAY function calculates the working day of a specified date relative
to another date. The working day is defined as the number of days which are not
Saturday or Sunday from the starting date to the specified date, plus one.
Hence, if the starting date is neither a Saturday nor a Sunday, it is working
day 1, the next non-weekend-day is working day 2 and so on.

Requesting the working day of a Saturday or a Sunday will return the working
day value of the prior Friday; it is not an error to query the working day of a
weekend day, you should instead check for this in the calling code.

If the **RELATIVE_TO** parameter is omitted it will default to the start of the
month of the **ADATE** parameter. In other words, by default this function
calculates the working day of the month of a given date.

If you wish to take into account more than merely weekend days when calculating
working days, insert values into :ref:`VACATIONS`. If a vacation date occurs
between the starting date and the target date (inclusive), it will count as
another weekend date resulting in a working day one less than would otherwise
be calculated. Note that the VACATIONS table will only be used when you specify
a value for the optional **ALOCATION** parameter. This parameter is used to
filter the content of the VACATIONS table under the assumption that different
locations, most likely countries, will have different public holidays.

Parameters
==========

ADATE
    The date to calculate the working day from.

RELATIVE_TO
    If specified, the date to calculate the working day relative to, i.e. the
    function counts the number of working days between **RELATIVE_TO** and
    **ADATE**.  If omitted, defaults to the start of the month of **ADATE**.

ALOCATION
    If specified, causes the function to take into account additional vacation
    days defined in :ref:`VACATIONS` with the specified *LOCATION*.

Examples
========

Calculate the working day of the first date in 2010:

.. code-block:: sql

    VALUES WORKINGDAY(YEARSTART(2010));

::

    1
    -----------
              1


Calculate the working day of the 4th of January, 2010 (the 2nd and 3rd of
January 2010 are Saturday and Sunday respectively):

.. code-block:: sql

    VALUES WORKINGDAY(DATE(2010, 1, 4))

::

    1
    -----------
              2


Calculate the number of working days in January 2010:

.. code-block:: sql

    VALUES WORKINGDAY(MONTHEND(2010, 1))

::

    1
    -----------
             21


Calculate the total number of working days in 2010:

.. code-block:: sql

    VALUES WORKINGDAY(YEAREND(2010), YEARSTART(2010))

::

    1
    -----------
            261
