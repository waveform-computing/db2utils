db2utils is a collection of utility routines for `IBM DB2 for
Linux/UNIX/Windows`_ (DB2 for LUW) which I have developed over several years as
a DBA to make my duties a little easier.

`Downloads`_ are available from `GitHub`_ which also hosts the `source code`_,
and the `bug tracker`_. `Documentation`_ is hosted by `ReadTheDocs`_, and
includes requirements, installation instructions, and an extensive reference
section.  The project is licensed under the `MIT license`_.

Please feel free to `contact me`_ with questions, suggestions or patches!
